 Here's an overview of news app: 

1.User Interface:
The user interface (UI) is the first thing the user sees when they open the app. 
The UI typically consists of a list of news articles, with each article showing the headline, a thumbnail image, and a brief summary.
When the user taps on an article, they are taken to a new screen that displays the full article.

2.API Integration:
The app  use's an API (Application Programming Interface) to fetch the latest news data from a server.
The API provides access to the latest news stories in a structured format, typically in JSON or XML.

3.Parsing:
Once the data is fetched from the API, the app would parse the JSON or XML response to extract the relevant information, such as the headline, summary, and image URL, for each article.
Kotlin's built-in support for JSON parsing, along with libraries such as Gson, make this task easier.

4.Storage:
App  stores the latest news data in a local database  to improve performance and reduce data usage.

Overall, the news app made using Kotlin  use's the language's features to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience, while making use of networking and database libraries to efficiently fetch and display the latest news articles
